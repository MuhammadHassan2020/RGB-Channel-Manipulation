# Image Processing with Python

This repository contains Python scripts that demonstrate fundamental image processing techniques using popular libraries such as NumPy, OpenCV, PIL (Pillow), and Matplotlib.

## Features

- **Image Representation with NumPy:**
  - Creating 4x4 matrices to represent images.
  - Splitting RGB channels and analyzing them individually.
  - Visualizing matrices with color mapping.

- **Image Handling with PIL (Pillow):**
  - Loading and displaying images.
  - Manipulating color channels (red, green, blue).

- **Image Processing with OpenCV:**
  - Reading images using `cv2.imread()`.
  - Converting images from BGR to RGB.
  - Resizing images with `cv2.resize()`.
  - Flipping images vertically and horizontally.
  - Grayscale conversion.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **NumPy** – for numerical computations and array manipulations.
- **Matplotlib** – for visualization of images and arrays.
- **Pillow (PIL)** – for image opening and manipulation.
- **OpenCV (cv2)** – for advanced image processing tasks.

## Installation

To run the code locally, ensure you have the required dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pillow opencv-python
